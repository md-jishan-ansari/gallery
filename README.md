## Features
In this Project, I make a Gallery website for containing persanal Photos for user, it contain
- Navbar
- Home (all uploaded Images present)
- bin (all deleted images present)
- Carousel


## Functionality and Approach
- ## Navbar
In navbar, there is a login signup button,  until you don't singup or login you can't access your uploded Images and other things

### Tech Stack used in Navbar: HTML, css, Bootstrap 
For login signup I used bootstrap model and I also used AJAX so that If any Input field filled wrong than user only have to change wrong filled input and rest input fields already filled with old value

### Home page

I used AJAX to fetch images and at starting only 12 images fetched by default and if user scroll than rest Images are fetched according to scrolling

Home page contain all images with there title, and user can update there title, user can share image and also can see images in carousel

- ## Carousel
In carousel, it displays current Images.
I made this carousel by using bootstrap carousel 
In starting time only 3 images fetched and when user click next button than next images fectch from backend and same goes for previous button


- ## Responsiveness

It works in any devices. It is fully responsive.
